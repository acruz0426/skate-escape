## Project Overview

### Goal
The Urban Skateboarding Escape Game is a 3D adventure where players control a rebellious skateboarder outrunning a cop in a non-skating zone. Set in an urban landscape filled with various obstacles, the game offers an immersive experience.

### Features
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- Increasing difficulty with game pace.
- Detailed textures for immersive environment.
- Advanced graphics using shading techniques.
- Realistic lighting effects.
- Efficient rendering of visible objects only.
- Randomized obstacle placement for unpredictability.
- Four different building textures for variety.
- Custom skater model for detailed animations.
- Collision Detection (Advanced Feature)

### Operation and Controls
- ‘Q’ to move left, ‘E’ to move right.
- ‘T’ to jump.
- ‘G’ to restart the game.

### Scoring and Levels
- Points based on distance without collisions.
- Progressive speed increases for difficulty.

### Sound Effects
- Background music for an engaging atmosphere.

### Challenges
- Managing object efficiency.
- Collision detection implementation.
- Creating realistic jumping animation.

## Conclusion
Skate Escape combines fast-paced gameplay, advanced graphics, and physics for an engaging player experience. It challenges players with quick decision-making and agility in an ever-changing urban setting.
